# Delegator function and liability
A delegator is a variant of a validator.  Gotabit GTB holders who cannot or do not wish to be validators can delegate their GTB tokens to validators and in return is able to extract a percentage of the revenue from them.

Delegators should participate in governance and must actively monitor the actions of the validators. If a validator is in breach of the staking rules and gets penalized, the delegators will also be punished.

By participating in governance, delegator makes their vote count on building the ecosystem.

A validator is like an agent to the delegator.
