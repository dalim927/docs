##  What is a delegator?
A delegator is a variant of validator. A delegator is someone who has ATOM tokens and cannot or does not wish to be a validator.

##  Choosing a validator
A delegator must also be alert to the reputation of a chosen validator.  They should build a social network like subscribing to Cosmos Hub forums where mutual interests and friendships are formed. 

##  Directives of delegators
When choosing a validator, delegator must do due diligence on them.  They must actively monitor on validator and participate in governance on voting ecosystem proposals. 

##  Revenue
Revenue comes from block provision and transaction fees. This is staking revenue shared with validator.

##  Validator Commission
Each validator receives a commission proportional to the total staking pool from the delegator.

##  Risks
Delegator shares the same systemic and financial risks faced by a validator.
For example. a non performing validator's staking server will also impact the revenue stream of the delegator.
