#  On-Chain Proposal Process
Please refer to [Cosmos On-Chain Proposal Process](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/governance/process.html)

Cosmos Hub uses on-chain voting by ATOM token for any change in the blockchain.

In a process of reaching agreement, a diverse group of community members including validators and delegators participate in the proposals.

## Voting
A quorum (represented by a minimum number of members in the group to be considered a valid meeting) requires: 

1. 40% of the total staked ATOM token to participate in a vote, and 
1. 50% of the token that participated in the vote needs to vote in favor of the proposal. 
1. There is also a "no with veto" option where if more than 33.4% of the vote goes to veto, the proposal is rejected even if there are enough votes for "yes."
