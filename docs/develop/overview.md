## Decentralized Application (dApp)
Software applications that are developed and deployed to run on a network of peer to peer computers using the blockchain are called decentralized applications (dApps). dApps runs without any central control on the peer to peer network.

## webAssembly and CosmWasm
webAssemby(wasm) is a stack based virtual machine that runs in binary instruction format and therefore has fast execution speed. CosmWasm smart contract platform is a Cosmos way of using webAssembly.

See examples of CosmWasm dApps [Gisele Schout article: DApps in Cosmos Ecosystem](https://medium.com/stakin/dapps-and-blockchains-built-on-the-cosmos-ecosystem-31731494570b)
