The following are other sample queries taken from forum communities.

# What is a Proof of Stake (PoS)?
Compared to Proof of Work (PoW), PoS is meant to be energy efficient where users can spin up a node to become validators to earn rewards without heavy mining equipment investment. A PoS blockchain can run with a network of decentralized nodes.

# How to become a validator, role and function?
Functioing validator properties are given below.
1. Provide a deposit bond to join as a validator.
1. Provide a security layer in the Proof of Stake network.
1. Contributes to the overall health of the network and assist in governance with it voting rights. In return, it earns staking rewards.
1. Provide block provisioning and as working participant in the Tendermint Core consensus engine. It adds new transactions to the blockchain by creating and broadcasting new blocks. 
1. Servers for running validators are compliant to a high level of security.
1. Prepared to be slashed or penalized for breach of security.

# Describe the risks involved in validator nodes?
1. Double spending risks. Validator should mitigate this by Tenderment KMS using variety of backend modules. See the [Chapter on validator security](/docs/node/validator/security/overview.md) 
1. Check validator reputation.  Get involved with the project community. As questions on project and see how decentralized the validator nodes are ie how many validator nodes are spun up by 1 user. The more nodes a user owns, the more centralized is the PoS network.
