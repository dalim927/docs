Gotabit uses a native GTB token. The token is distributed using a supply and demand model. The health of the project can be found in this model. For example, if the token liquidity plummets, the market forces a negative behaviour and physchology that will affect its value. The token economy, or just tokenomic exerts material affect on the project and value.

Using tokenomics, GotaBit's GTB token intrinsic value is impacted by factors in the creation, distribution, demand and supply and economic activity (use cases) utilizing the token. For example, GTB owners are incentivize by stake mining to earn rewards, trading (BUY/SELL) or lending (yield farming, decentralized finance) to others for a return. 

An example token distribution of Gotabit is given in the table below based on a total token supply of XXXX GTB tokens.
